### Minor Changes

- 52da88b: Make crab'd's comment branding configurable. A new `appearance` config section sets the display
  name (`appearance.name`), the brand emoji prefixed to comments (`appearance.emoji` — set to `""` to
  remove it), and whether the `posted by` footer is shown (`appearance.footer`). Defaults reproduce the
  current look (`crab'd` / `🦀` / footer on). Status glyphs (⚠️/⏳/➡️) are unaffected, and the hidden
  tracking marker is always kept so sticky comment reuse still works even with the footer off.
- 7fbc83f: Config-driven cross-repo read access and private npm registries — no workflow changes.

  - **`repos.read`** (`'all'` or a list of `owner/repo`, globs allowed) lets the agent **read** other
    repositories. crab'd mints a **read-only, least-privilege** forge token scoped to what you allow and
    exposes it to the model's shell as `GH_TOKEN` (with `git` preconfigured), so it can `gh api` / `git
clone` those repos on demand — never write to them. Requires your own App (`CRABD_APP_*`), a scoped
    PAT, or (on Forgejo) a scoped `CRABD_FORGEJO_TOKEN`; the git credential and prompt guidance are
    forge-aware. The token broker stays single-repo by design (`repos.read` is ignored under it, with a
    log note).
  - **`sandbox.env` + `sandbox.npmrc`** authenticate `pnpm`/`npm install` against private registries:
    forward named CI-secret env vars into the shell, and write a managed `.npmrc` (via
    `NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG`, never clobbering the repo's own) whose auth lines reference tokens by
    env-var name — no secret literal touches config or disk. GitHub Packages in the same org can reuse
    the forge token.
  - Both sections are **governance-lockable** (`repos.read`, `sandbox.env`, `sandbox.npmrc`) so an org
    can forbid repos from self-granting cross-repo or secret access. The built-in prompt now reflects
    any granted cross-repo access. The action image adds the `gh` CLI.

- 245741e: Load repo-authored context into the run. crab'd now reads the repository's own `AGENTS.md` and
  `CLAUDE.md` from the checkout root and appends them to the system prompt (after its base + configured
  instructions, so core rules stay authoritative), and discovers skills under `.agents/skills/` and
  `.claude/skills/` — listing each skill's name and description so the agent reads the matching
  `SKILL.md` on demand (progressive disclosure). Both are on by default and configurable via the new
  `context` config section (`context.instruction_files`, `context.skills`).

### Patch Changes

- d51c64d: Adds support for AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md as well as skills located in .agents/skills/ and .claude/skills/.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a965d53: Adds rate limiting hanlder functionality and related settings.

  When a model gets rate limited, users can now configure fallback models and the specific timeouts and how many retries crab'd should attempt. The bot identity will also update the persistent comment with relevant information. See the [rate limiting docs](https://crabd.lou.gg/reference/rate-limiting) for more info.
